# Layers Theme PluginExample

Welcome to the example theme which will help you to convert your Layers team to a proper plugin which can be used with the Layers Manager app since version 4.0

If you want to learn what a plugin overlay is and how to use it, have a look at the Wiki found here https://github.com/BitSyko/LayersThemePlugin_Example/wiki

The current plugin Version is 1.1 which was released on the twenty second of July 2015.

* Whats new in Version 1.1?
  * Easier adoption for new themers:
  * Move most of the changes a themer has to make from android manifest to strings.xml
  * Split the Layers_OverlayNames into NormalOverlaynames and StyleSpecificoverlayNames
  * New recommended screenshot height: 750px (to prevent the layers Manager app from crashing on Low Memory devices)
  * A new documentation on how to make a Plugin Overlay
  
  
* Whats new in Version 1.0?
  * Initial Release
